## Stack
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - For something quick, it's best to use the tools you're familiar with, right?
- [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap) - Used to get a *snapshot* of the app; a *prerender* of sorts.
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - CSS-in-JS styling goodness.
- [Generatr](https://github.com/johnpaulada/generatr) - I used this simple library I built to generate the text. This was based on Tracery. I originally intended to use Tracery but I couldn't get it to work so I made a simple one instead.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - For auto-deployment, asset optimization, additional prerendering, etc.
